In my daily life, whether at a cafe or walking in the park, I kept hearing curious questions about AI art. "Who's behind this artwork?" "Where did the AI pull these images from?" It seemed like everywhere I went, people were buzzing with wonder about the origins of AI-generated pieces.

Every time I heard these questions, an idea started to form in the back of my mind. "What if there was a clear way to answer all these questions?" I thought about a tool that could not only craft captivating visuals but also trace back to their roots.

With the energy and enthusiasm of these everyday conversations, I decided to turn this idea into reality for HackTX2023. A tool that demystifies AI art, making it transparent and relatable for all.
